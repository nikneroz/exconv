# Exconv

A small Elixir library for converting text between the unicode and different character sets inspired by [erlyconv](https://github.com/eugenehr/erlyconv).

# Test code

```
# 0xE9	0x0439	#CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER SHORT I

iex(61)> {:ok, file} = File.open("/Users/rozenkin/Desktop/cp037")
{:ok, #PID<0.238.0>}
iex(62)> x = IO.binread(file, :all)
<<233, 246, 243, 234, 229, 237, 227, 248, 249, 231>>
iex(63)> "\xE9"
<<233>>
iex(64)> "\u0439"
"Ð¹"
```
